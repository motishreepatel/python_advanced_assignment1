    "#Answer:\n",
    "In Python, when you access an attribute on an object, the inheritance search follows a specific order known as the method resolution order (MRO). The MRO determines where Python looks for the attribute if it is not found in the current object. The MRO is defined by the inheritance hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MRO search for an attribute follows a depth-first, left-to-right order. It looks in the following locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The instance itself: If the attribute is present in the instance, it is directly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The class of the instance: If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python looks for it in the class of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The superclass(es): If the attribute is not found in the class, Python continues searching in the next class in the inheritance hierarchy, following the order of inheritance specified by the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repeat step 3 until the attribute is found or there are no more classes in the inheritance hierarchy."

    "#Q - Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "In Python, the first argument in a class's method function is conventionally named self, although any valid variable name can be used. The self parameter is special because it represents the instance of the class on which the method is being called. It allows the method to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and perform operations specific to that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points that make the self parameter special:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instance Context: When a method is called on an instance of a class, the self parameter is automatically passed as the first argument by Python. This parameter provides a reference to the instance itself, allowing the method to access its attributes and perform operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessing Attributes: By using the self parameter, methods can access the instance's attributes and work with their current values. For example, self.attribute_name refers to an attribute of the instance, allowing you to read or modify its value within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method Invocation: When a method is invoked using the dot notation on an instance (e.g., instance.method()), Python automatically binds the instance to the self parameter. This way, the method can refer to the specific instance it was called on, even if multiple instances of the class exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Differentiating Instances: The self parameter helps distinguish between attributes and methods that are specific to each instance of a class. It allows different instances to have their own unique state and behavior, as each instance can access and modify its own attributes separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Method Chaining: The self parameter enables method chaining, where multiple method calls can be chained together on the same instance. Each method can return self, allowing subsequent methods to be called on the same instance, leading to more concise and readable code."

    "- Customization: By defining the __init__ method in your class, you can customize the initialization process and ensure that specific actions or calculations are performed when an instance is created. This customization can include setting default attribute values, validating input, or performing any other necessary setup.\n",
